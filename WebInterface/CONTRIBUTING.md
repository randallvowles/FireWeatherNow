# Instructions for Logging Issues or adding a Suggestion

## 1\. Read the FAQ

Please [read the FAQ](docs/faq.md) before logging new issues, even if you think you have found a bug. We will close any issue already answered in the FAQ.

## 2\. Search for Duplicates

Take a moment to look at the [current issues](https://github.com/mesowx/MesonetJS/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) before logging a new one.

## 3\. Do you have a question?

We use the issue tracker for __issues__, in other words, bugs and suggestions. If you have a _question_, please use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mesonet), or email us at [mesonetjs@synopticlabs.org](mailto:mesonetjs@syntopticlabs.org) .

## 4\. Did you find a bug?

When logging a bug, please be sure to include the following:

- What version of MesonetJS you're using
- If at all possible, an _isolated_ way to reproduce the behavior
- The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior

You can try our current development build by pulling the GitHub repository.

## 5\. Do you have a suggestion?

We prefer to accept suggestions via the issue tracker.

Information to include with your suggestion:

- A description of the problem you're trying to solve
- An overview of the suggested solution
- Examples of how the suggestion would work in various cases

## Contributing bug fixes

TypeScript is currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes. A bug must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved ("Milestone == Community") by the TypeScript team. Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing. If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.

## Contributing features

Features (things that add new or improved functionality to MesonetJS) may be accepted, but will need to first be approved (marked as "Milestone == Community" by the MesonetJS team with the message "Approved") in the suggestion issue.

## Legal

Any submission to this project testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

## Making a pull request

Your pull request should:

- Include a description of what your change intends to do
- Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the __master__ branch

  - Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your PR)

- Have clear commit messages

  - e.g. "Refactor feature", "Fix issue", "Add tests for issue"
